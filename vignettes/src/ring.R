## This package implements ring buffers.  A ring buffer can be used as
## a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer where the maximum size is known
## ahead of time.  Because they do not grow in size, they are useful
## to avoid using more and more memory as a process runs.  Because the
## data reading and writing happens in an (apparently) circular way,
## once data is added to the buffer it is not copied (in contrast if
## you used a vector then every time data is consumed you'd have to
## shuffle the vector around).

## `ring` implements two different ring buffers that will likely suit
## different applications.
##
## * `ring_buffer_bytes` is imlemented as a byte array in C, possibly
##   with a "stride" indicating a set of bytes that go together.  Once
##   the data reaches the end of the array we start writing to the
##   beginning again.
## * `ring_buffer_env` is implemented as a doubly linked list using
##   R's environments.  This buffer can hold arbitrary R objects at
##   each position.

## # The environment buffer `ring_buffer_env`

## This is the simplest buffer to understand because we don't have to
## deal with raw vectors.

## To create a buffer that can hold up to 100 elements, use the
## `ring_buffer_env` function:
buf <- ring::ring_buffer_env(100)

## This is an [R6](https://github.com/wch/R6) class, with several methods:
buf

## Operations on the class happen by running methods using `$`.  So
## the size of the buffer:
buf$size()

## ...the number of elements free and used:
buf$free()
buf$used()

## ...whether the buffer is empty or full:
buf$is_empty()
buf$is_full()

## To start using the buffer we need to put some data in it.  There
## are two main functions for adding data:

## * `buf$set(data, n)` sets `n` elements to be the value `data`
## * `buf$push(data, iterate)` pushes `data` into the buffer, with the
##   `iterate` argument indicating if we should iterate over `data` or
##   treat it as a single element

## So to set the first 5 elements to be "a", "b", ..., "e", use:
buf$push(letters[1:5])

## The buffer is no longer empty
buf$is_empty()

## ...having 5 elements:
buf$used()

## ...and room for 95 more:
buf$free()

## To read the content of the buffer without modifying it, use
## `read(n)` where `n` is the number of elements to read.  This
## *always* returns a list of length `n`:
buf$read(1)
buf$read(2)

## If you try to read too far, then the buffer will underflow and you
## will get an error:
##+ error = TRUE
buf$read(20)

## If you just want the the first element, use `tail()`
buf$tail()

## The tail returns the first element in (so the buffer naturally
## operates as a first-in-first-out queue).

## You can also read the most recently added element with `head()`
buf$head()

## And you can offset these by an integer number of steps.  So moving
## one position into the buffer from the tail gets the second element
## added:
buf$tail_offset(1)

## or moving three elements into the buffer from the head (most
## recently added elemnt) gets the same bit of data
buf$head_offset(3)

## The above operations are all nondestructive -- they leave the
## buffer unchanged.  To consume elements, use `take(n)` which
## operates the same way as `read` but it also moves the buffer
## `tail`; it consumes elements leaving space for more.
buf$free()
buf$take(1)
buf$free()

## Now we have consumed an element the tail has moved along, so `tail`
## contains "b" and "a" is removed from the buffer:
buf$tail()

## To reset the buffer, use `reset()`.  This empies the buffer of all data:
buf$reset()
buf$used()
buf$is_empty()

## While the ring buffer is fixed in size in typical use, you can grow
## it explicitly.  To add additional space, use the `grow` method:
buf$size()
buf$grow(20)
buf$size()

## ## Application: simulation with recent history

## The whole point of the ring buffer though is that we can push
## things onto it and pull the most recent out, even when the number
## of things pushed *overall* is larger than the buffer size.

## So imagine a simulation where we need to keep track of the last 5
## steps.  The simulation is a random walk.
step <- function(x) {
  if (runif(1) < 0.5) x - 1L else x + 1L
}

x <- 0L
buf <- ring::ring_buffer_env(5)
h <- integer(20)
buf$push(x)
h[1L] <- x

set.seed(1)
for (i in seq_len(length(h) - 1L)) {
  x <- step(x)
  buf$push(x)
  h[i + 1L] <- x
}

## The whole history:
h

## The last 5 steps:
unlist(buf$read(5))

## So we could rewrite the simulation so that the random walk tends up
## if the last few steps have been increases and tends down if the
## last few steps have been decreases:
step <- function(x) {
  if (length(x) > 1) {
    p <- mean(diff(x)) / 2 + 0.5
  } else {
    p <- 0.5
  }
  if (runif(1) < p) x[length(x)] - 1L else x[length(x)] + 1L
}

x <- 0L
buf <- ring::ring_buffer_env(5)
h <- integer(100)
buf$push(x)
h[1L] <- x

set.seed(1)
for (i in seq_len(length(h) - 1L)) {
  x <- step(unlist(buf$read(buf$used())))
  buf$push(x)
  h[i + 1L] <- x
}

## Now we have a simulation with a strong mean reverting tendency:
par(mar = c(4, 4, .5, .5))
plot(h, type = "l", xlab = "step", ylab = "y", las = 1)

## Because the buffer always holds the last 5 (or fewer) elements the
## book-keeping involved in working with the last few elements out is
## simlified.  Ignoring the fact that we hold the entire history in
## the fixed size vector `h`, only the last few elements need to be
## retained which may be useful if the simulation generates a lot of
## data.

## A downside of this implementation is that `buf$read()` returns a
## list that must be turned into a vector with `unlist`, even though
## we know in this case that the simulation will always produce an
## integer vector.  The ring buffers described below can help with
## that problem.

## # The bytes buffer `ring_buffer_bytes`

## This is the classical implementation of a ring buffer, and the
## implementation is broadly based on the one
## [here](https://github.com/dhess/c-ringbuf), by
## [\@dhess](https://github.com/dhess).

## This operates basically the same way as `ring_buffer_env`, and
## presents a very similar interface to R, but with a few key
## differences:

## * The contents of the buffer are raw bytes (using R's raw vectors).
##   These are a bit fiddly to work with but can be very powerful.
## * The `iterate` distinction of `push` disappears because there is
##   no ambiguity with R objects

## To construct a buffer of 1000 bytes:
buf <- ring::ring_buffer_bytes(1000)

## Most of the same methods apply directly:
buf$free()
buf$used()
buf$is_full()
buf$is_empty()

## Generate a byte sequence:
bytes <- as.raw(0:255)

## ...and push them into the buffer:
buf$push(bytes)

## ...read from the buffer
buf$read(10)

## ...destructively take the oldest elements
buf$used()
buf$take(20)
buf$used()

## ## Striding

## Single bytes can hold only values 0 to 255 (or character
## equivalents, such as `a` becomes `r charToRaw("a")` via
## `charToRaw("a")`.  But if you want to hold a full integer, that
## (usually) takes 4 bytes, a double (usually) takes 8.

## To allow this, a bytes buffer can be "strided"; this indicates the
## number of consecutive bytes that should together make up one
## logical entry.  The buffer then contains `size` of these.  So to
## create a buffer of 100 entries, each of `8` bytes you could do:
buf <- ring::ring_buffer_bytes(100, 8)

## Each element pushed onto the buffer must have the correct size.  So
## to push the byte sequence 1..8 onto the buffer:
buf$push(as.raw(1:8))

## but if you pushed more or less it would be an error:
##+ error = TRUE
buf$push(as.raw(1:4))

## Reading happens in *logical* units, not bytes:
buf$read(1)

## and you can get the number of elements used:
buf$used()

## or the number of bytes
buf$used(bytes = TRUE)

## ## The typed bytes buffer `ring_buffer_bytes_typed`

## If 8 bytes is a double, it should be possible to make a bytes
## buffer that holds one (or more) doubles per entry.  That is what
## the `ring_buffer_bytes_typed` buffer does, with a few corner cases
## dealt with.  To use, you decide what the *R interpretation* of an
## entry is, it will determine the size per entry and appropriate
## encoding and decoding functions and you can ignore that it is
## storing bytes.  For performance reasons this does not use R's
## serialisation and simply copies the data stored in vectors.

## For example, to make a buffer of 10 elements, each of which is a
## single real number (double), use:
buf <- ring::ring_buffer_bytes_typed(10, double(1))

## onto which real numbers can be pushed:
buf$push(pi)

## And retrieve the data.
buf$take(1)

## Entries can contain more than one number; to make a buffer of
## length 10, each element of which is a vector of 5 doubles:
buf <- ring::ring_buffer_bytes_typed(10, double(5))
buf$push(rnorm(5))
buf$read(1)

## Because this is just implemented as a byte array, we can just push
## a bunch of numbers straight into the buffer:
buf$push(rnorm(5 * 10))

## With elements in the buffer, we can request them.  The integer
## argument of `take` indicates the number of groups of 5 doubles we
## would like back:
buf$take(1)

## If you try to take more than is in the buffer it is an error:
##+ error = TRUE
buf$take(10)

## ## The translating bytes buffer `ring_buffer_bytes_translate`

## The `ring_buffer_bytes_typed` function is implemented by
## translating R objects to bytes (when storing with `$set()`,
## `$push()`, etc). and from bytes back to R objects (when retrieving
## with `$read()`, `$take()`, etc).  `ring_buffer_bytes_translate`
## exposes this interface.

## The "typed" buffers do not allow storing strings because they can
## be any number of bytes long (the bytes buffers require a fixed
## "stride" within a buffer).  But we can store fixed length strings.

## To convert a string to a byte sequence, use `charToRaw` (or
## `as.raw(utf8ToInt(x))`, but then multi-byte sequences might start
## being difficult).
(bytes <- charToRaw("hello world"))

## The inverse transformation is `rawToChar` (or `intToUtf8(as.integer(x))`):
rawToChar(bytes)

## The function `ring_buffer_bytes_translate` takes these functions as
## its 3rd and fourth arguments.  So to make a buffer that will hold
## up to 100 strings, each of 8 bytes:
b <- ring::ring_buffer_bytes_translate(100, 8, charToRaw, rawToChar)

## We can now store 8 character strings:
b$push("abcdefgh")
b$tail()

## But other length strings cannot be added:
##+ error = TRUE
b$push("hello!")

## Probably this would be most useful storing just single characters
## as then it would make a buffer of *text*.

## # The C API

## The `ring` package can be used in other R packages using the
## `LinkingTo` mechanism.  To do so:
##
## * In your `DESCRIPTION`, add a line `LinkingTo: ring` (you do not
##   need to include `ring` in `Depends` or `Imports` as we need it
##   only for the package build).
##
## * In your `src/` directory, add a file `ring.c` containing just the
##   line `#include <ring/ring.c>` (but see the note in the
##   documentation for `ring_buffer_create` below).
##
## * Anywhere in your code you want to use the ring buffer, include
##   the line `#include <dde/dde.h>` to include the prototypes and use
##   the interface as described below.
##
## (I am not sure what the best practice way of doing this with a
## standalone shared library compiled with `R CMD SHLIB` is though;
## probably best to make a package.)

## The C API is documented only in the header file, and it should be
## fairly straightforward to use (with reference to the docs above;
## this is the code underlying the `ring_buffer_bytes` interface).

##+ echo = FALSE, results = "asis"
writeLines(c("```c",
             readLines(system.file("include/ring/ring.h", package = "ring")),
             "```"))

## For a complete real-world example of use, see
## [dde](https://github.com/richfitz/dde), which uses a ring buffer to
## hold the history of a set of differential equations, and uses that
## to implement delay equations.  Here, the ring buffer means that the
## memory requirements don't grow with the length of running the
## simulation (as it only cares about fairly recent history, the
## natural overflow from the ring buffer is well suited).  The memory
## is only allocated at the beginning of the simulation so there is no
## additional memory allocations.  And because `ring` returns (const)
## pointers to the appropriate place in memory there is little
## copying.

## A simple application that implements the same mean-reverting
## simulation from above:

##+ echo = FALSE, results = "asis"
writeLines(c("```c",
             readLines(system.file("examples/example.c", package = "ring")),
             "```"))

## # The C++ API

## If you're using C++ you may find the [Boost circular
## buffer](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/circular_buffer.html)
## is likely to be far better; you can use this by `LinkingTo:` the
## `BH` package and using `#include <boost/circular_buffer.hpp>` in
## your code.

## Alternatively, the `ring` C code can be directly used in C++
## as above.  Or, there is a class-based approach available:
##
## * In your `src/` directory, add a file `ring.cpp` containing just the
##   line `#include <ring/ring.cpp>`
##
## * Anywhere in your code you want to use the ring buffer, include
##   the line `#include <dde/dde.hpp>` to include the class definition:

##+ echo = FALSE, results = "asis"
writeLines(c("```cpp",
             readLines(system.file("include/ring/ring.hpp", package = "ring")),
             "```"))
