 * in a single invocation, since that size will cause all bytes in the
 * ring buffer to be written exactly once each.
 *
 * Note that if len is greater than the number of free bytes in buffer,
 * the ring buffer will overflow. When an overflow occurs, the state
 * of the ring buffer is guaranteed to be consistent, including the
 * head and tail pointers; old data will simply be overwritten in FIFO
 * fashion, as needed. However, note that, if calling the function
 * results in an overflow, the value of the ring buffer's tail pointer
 * may be different than it was before the function was called.

 * Returns the actual number of bytes written to buffer: len, if len <
 * ring_buffer_bytes_data(buffer), else
 * ring_buffer_bytes_data(buffer).
