\usage{
ring_matrix(nr_max, nc, type, environment = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nr_max}{The maximum number of rows}

\item{nc}{The number of columns in the matrix}

\item{type}{The type of storage.  Can be "logical", "integer",
"double", or "complex"}

\item{environment}{Logical indicating if we should use an
environment buffer (\code{\link{ring_buffer_env}}) or
a bytes buffer (\code{\link{ring_buffer_bytes}}).}
}
\description{
Simulate a matrix with a ring buffer.  This exists mostly as an
example of use of a ring buffer designed to work with R functions
that do not know (or care) that the object is implemented with a
ring buffer behind the scenes.  Rows will be added at the bottom
of the matrix.
}
\details{
Note that because the matrix is stored row-wise but R stores
matrices column wise, there is a lot of data transposing going on
here.  If something like this was needed for performance then
you'd want to redo this with column storage.
